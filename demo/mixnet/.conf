# If you are running the demonstration with the same user and remote

#
# These values are only used to configure the way the demo
# orchestrates the other servers, i.e., it does not influence the
# mix-servers themselves.
#
# If these variables are defined, then they take precedence over any

# If you comment out the default variables above, then you may define
# a particular username and hostname for each mix-server to
# demonstrate. Make sure that the number of entries match the
# NO_MIXSERVERS above and that the above default values are commented
# out. For this to work you need to enable password-less login from
# the orchestrating server to each remote server, but you do not need

# Even if MAX_NO_CIPHERTEXTS is set, you can still set the following
# variable to demonstrate the ability to override the default for a
# given session by passing the "-maxciph" to vmni.

#FORCED_MAX_NO_CIPHERTEXTS=300

# Finally, the actual number of ciphertexts. You must define this to

#
# Note that in native mode, P-224, P-256, and P-521 are faster than
# other curves of the same size due to optimized C code borrowed from
# the OpenSSL project.

# Note that all you need to do to use your own group implementation is
# to subclass verificatum.arithm.BPGroup and

# It is possible to use the mix-net and let the public key itself be

# If you set the following variable specifying the default width of
# ciphertexts, then the value will be stored in the protocol info
# file. (If you don't set it then it defaults to one.)
#
# Use this option and look at the plaintexts to see that they grow in
# size and become larger than what can be embedded into a single group
# element.

#WIDTH=2

# Even if WIDTH is set, you can still set the following variable to
# demonstrate the ability to override the default for a given session
# by passing the "-width" option to "vmn -precomp". Remember to
# generate new ciphertexts of the right width if you use this.

#FORCED_WIDTH=3

# Choose the interface to the mix-net.
#
# Use "json" for JSON encoding for the public key, ciphertexts, and
# plaintexts. It currently only works when using a subgroup of the
# multiplicative group modulo a prime.
#
# Use "raw" for the internal format of Verificatum where the public
# key is a byte tree, and the input and output are byte tree
# representations of arrays of group elements. (Note that if you use
# this form, the output will be a binary file. You can still inspect
# it using the tool vbt that prints a structured JSON representation
# of the data.)
#
# Use "native" for a format where the the byte tree representation of
# the public key is converted to a hexadecimal string, and the input
# is a newline-separated file of hexadecimal encoded byte trees of
# ciphertexts, and the output is a newline separated list of strings
# decoded from the plaintext group elements according to the decoding
# algorithm of the underlying group.

#INTER=jsondecode
#INTER=raw

# Determines the collision-resistant hashfunction used to implement
# the Naor-Yung CCA2-secure cryptosystem. STANDARD gives SHA-512 (this
# is also the default in Verificatum). Provable gives the
# Merkle-Damgaard construction based on the Pedersen hashfunction in
# the elliptic curve P-256 (see info_files for more details). Note
# that we need the output of the hash function to be smaller than the
# order of the group in which we are running Naor-Yung. The latter
# group is hardcoded in info_files to P-521 (this is also the default
# in Verificatum).

#HASH=PROVABLE
HASH=STANDARD

# Determines the PRG used to derive "random" vectors used for
# batching. You can use SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512, or an instance
# of verificatum.crypto.PRG. In the former cases "counter mode" is
# used to generate the output.

# Keep arrays in RAM or on file. The memory requirements of the second

# If a server is behind a NAT, then port forwarding is probably used
# to expose the server. In this case the hostname/ip number and ports
# are different for the other servers and on the local network. The
# following offsets are used to generate local port numbers. Do not
# change these unless you really have to, since the port numbers are
